**Techniques used in Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Used impuatation if there are any missing values. Also used statistics for finding outliers.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Used describe function to know the measures like sum,min,max,range,mean,median,mode and standard deviation.
3. **Data Visualization:** Different Visualizations of histograms, box plots, scatter plots, line plots, heatmaps, and bar charts are used to know relationship(correlation)  between dependent variables and independent variables, to check any missisng values.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering is done for scaling, normalization on numerical variables and encoding on categorical variables.
